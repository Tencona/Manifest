# Storage
*Everything should be considered a collection, like in NoSQL.*
* Types
* Properties
* Items


# Types


# Properties


# Items
Items can't use a reference to their Type's Properties for storing values, they need an internal map of a Property and the value for it.

Should an Item be allowed to have multiple Types? There's not a huge reason to say no. Multiple inheritence can be useful.
