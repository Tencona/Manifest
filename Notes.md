# Storage


# Types


# Properties


# Items
Items can't use a reference to their Type's Properties for storing values, they need an internal map of a Property and the value for it.

Should an Item be allowed to have multiple Types? There's not a huge reason to say no. Multiple inheritence can be useful.
